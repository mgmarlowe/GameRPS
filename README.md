A quick game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. For The Odin Project assignment.


What I learned:
 - Writing out code on paper helps the ultimate readibility of the code. Not to mention helps me to not feel overwhelmed by the blank screen.
 - I had to be reminded that a function that informs a variable must be called again to update that variable.
 - Figured out how to create a random variable.
 - Reviewed the difference between 'console.log' and 'return' when I couldn't get my program to say anything to me.
 
 
What I need to learn now:
  - Is there a better way to select a random variable?
  - Is there a more concise way to flow through the possibilities for the rounds?
